# Registration Form :memo:<br/>
***A signup page (also known as a registration page) enables users and organizations to independently register and gain access to your system.***<br/>
This is a simple Registration Form which is build using *HTML and CSS.*<br/>
The registration/signup form contains various input fields of different input details where the user needs to fill in his/her details to submit for a particular web page.<br/>
There are various types of registration but the main purpose of this type of form is to collect users' information or details.<br/>
In the Registration Form webpage I have added the following elements :-<br/>
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Password
- Age
- Type of Account
- File Uploading
- Submit button<br/>
